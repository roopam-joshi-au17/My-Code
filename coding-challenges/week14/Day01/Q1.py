(5 marks)
(Easy)
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two
nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
between them.
Example 1:
ï¿¼
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        ans = 0
        def dfs(node):
            nonlocal ans
            if not node:
                return 0
            else:
                left = dfs(node.left)
                right = dfs(node.right)
                if left + right > ans:
                    ans = left + right
				if left > ans:
					ans = left
				if right > ans:
					ans = right
                return 1 + max(left, right)
        dfs(root)
        return ans
